# 👋🏻 Well met, traveler!

### Allow myself, to introduce... myself... and my dog!

</br>

> _Welp, I'm Eli, and me dag's name is Bert. Albert. Albert Einstein. He bids you a jolly day! Do you like dags?_

</br>

### **Here are some things I enjoy:**

1. Spending time with my little `family`! My lovely Thai wife and our beautiful daughter (9/mo), and our bestest boi `Bert` 🐕‍🦺!
1. The `Great Outdoors` 🏔! Hiking, camping, hunting and fishing. I had the privilege of growing up in The Last Frontier, **Nikiski, AK** to be precise (look it up!). And I do declare! Tain't no where I'd rather be!
1. All things `Tech` 💻! Whether it be a tinker'n on a Raspberry Pi, gettin' cray cray with the crypto, printing out lil' bits 'n bots in the 3rd dimension, or just straight hack'n it up with some beloved `CODE`. Your boy is **GEEK'd** out to the extreme!
1. `Playing sports` & `skateboarding`! Bangin' out fresh flow'n flips of the nollie persuasion is divine. Pickle Ball is rad. Volleyball, tossin' the ol' pig skin, and fling'n around a frisbee are some of my favs! But I don't discriminate when it comes to games that are physical in nature.
1. Having a `curious mind` 🧠🧐. I derive the utmost satisfaction from being easily intrigued. The more that I learn, the more fantastical things appear. Tis' indeed a **Wonderful World** in which we live... and don't even get me _started_ on the `Cosmos`...

</br>

OK, that's enough for now... I should probably get back to work, and I reckon **YOU** have better things to do with your time!

### **Thanks for reading! Safe travels, friend!**
